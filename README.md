## About

Sentispace is an installable PWA diary app that's built with privacy in mind. You can log your daily activities and feelings, and the app provides summaries and trends for the day, week, or month. One of its key features is caching for offline access, allowing you to interact with your diary even when you're not connected to the internet. Everything runs on the user's own deviceâ€”no back-end involved. The app is built using Vite, React, TypeScript and Dexie.

## Origin Story

My chronic health conditions got worse, so I needed to track my daily activities closely. I couldn't find any existing apps that met my specific privacy and functionality needs, so I created my own. After sharing with friends, I saw a greater need and chose to release it as an open-source app for everyone.

## Features

-   Activity Management: Create, modify, and delete activities with ease.
-   Organize with Categories: Assign activities to specific categories for enhanced tracking.
-   Quick Duplication: Clone activities to quickly repeat them without re-entry.
-   Activity Templates: Save activities as templates for future use.
-   Data Handling: Options to import, export, and permanently delete user data.
-   Daily Overview: Access a daily view of activities.
-   Navigate Weekly: Browse through days with a convenient weekly carousel.
